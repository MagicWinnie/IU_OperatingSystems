The output of me running `./ex3.sh` can be found in `ex3_log.txt`.

Both `si` and `so` remain 0 throughout the work of the program as my machine has enough RAM not to swap anything out.
Memory usage increases as I do not free allocated memory. If you uncomment `free` line, memory usage will remain constant
as allocated memory will be freed.
