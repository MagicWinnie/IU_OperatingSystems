I have run my script with n = 3, and all my subscribers have got the message.
Because each of these subscribers was working with a separate named pipe.

Named pipes work in a FIFO (First In First Out) manner, so they are queues.
Then if a subscriber reads a message from the pipe, then it gets deleted.

So, let us have two processes subscribe for one named pipe. If the first one
reads the message, then the other one process cannot read the other message.

Therefore, we have to have separate named pipes between each pair of processes.
