I have executed the program for all three algorithms using the same input for three different values of number of frames.
The results can be seen here:

Random:
    Number of frames: 128
        Disk accesses: 1269
        Hit ratio: 13%
    Number of frames: 32
        Disk accesses: 1449
        Hit ratio: 3.2%
    Number of frames: 8
        Disk accesses: 1492
        Hit ratio: 0.8%
NFU:
    Number of frames: 128
        Disk accesses: 1264
        Hit ratio: 12.3%
    Number of frames: 32
        Disk accesses: 1439
        Hit ratio: 3.3%
    Number of frames: 8
        Disk accesses: 1492
        Hit ratio: 0.7%
Aging:
    Number of frames: 128
        Disk accesses: 1264
        Hit ratio: 12.3%
    Number of frames: 32
        Disk accesses: 1439
        Hit ratio: 3.3%
    Number of frames: 8
        Disk accesses: 1492
        Hit ratio: 0.7%

Random algorithm seems to perform the best as for 128 and 8 frames it gives the highest of hit ratios.
NFU and Aging algorithms output the same results for all number of frames. Which seems strange.
For all algorithms when lowering down the number of frames, hit ratio lowers down as we have to make
more page faults.
