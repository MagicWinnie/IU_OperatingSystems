For the provided `queries.txt` file my solution printed this values:

First fit: 104.390793
Best fit: 32.040252
Worst fit: 27.605668

It clearly shows that first fit algorithm is much faster than other methods.
This is because it doesn't traverse the whole array and returns the first
found suitable free block. Best fit algorithm is much slower than first fit
because it searches for all suitable free blocks and finds the smallest one.
Worst fit perfoms the worst :). It likely happens because it has to find the
biggest block, therefore, traversing through blocks of bigger sizes, which
takes a little more time.
