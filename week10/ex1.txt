Output of `ex1.sh` can be found in `ex1.log`.
Output of `monitor.c` can be found in `monitor.log`.

1. Yes, `monitor.c` has reported a modification event for `myfile11.txt`.
   `myfile11.txt` is a hard link, which means it points to the data of the
   original file and `myfile11.txt` can be modified.
2. No, `monitor.c` did not report any changes for `myfile13.txt`.
   It happens because `myfile13.txt` is a symbolic link, which means it points
   to the original file, not the data itself. So, modifying the original file
   does not trigger any events.
3. Number of hard links is equal to 2.
   One is between `myfile11.txt` and the data of the original file. Second is between
   `/tmp/myfile1.txt` and the data of the original file.
