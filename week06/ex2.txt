1. When TRI_BASE is lowered down to 100, workers start to find much more triangular numbers,
   as they are more densly located closer to 0.

2. Processes are executed in the following order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. As per the exercise,
   if we have the same arrival time, then we execute the process with the least index.
