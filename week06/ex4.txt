Running with quantum = 3.
Compared to exercises 2 and 3, the processes are executed in the following order: 4, 3, 5, 0, 4, 1, 3, 6, 1, 3, 2, 6.
Some processes are executed several times, as Round-Robin is a pre-emptive algorithm. Some processes are stopped and
then resumed. Using this arrangement, RR's average Waiting Time and average Turnaround Time are slightly higher than
FCFS's and much higher than SJF's. This happens as we switch processes each constant amount of time, so processes
need to wait a little bit more.

Outputs of exercises 2, 3, and 4 can be found in files fifo.log, sjf.log, and rr.log, respectively.
