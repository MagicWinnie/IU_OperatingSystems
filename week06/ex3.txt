Compared to exercise 2, the processes will be processed in the following order: 4, 5, 0, 1, 6, 2, 3.
This arrangement is more optimal than First Come First Served algorithm's arrangement.
Therefore, average Waiting Time and average Turnaround Time is much lower than in FCFS.
But, in some conditions long processes can be never processed.
