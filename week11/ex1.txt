===================================
After changing the root directory of the process, looking up `/` inside of the program, it shows up files and directories in `./lofsdisk` folder.
But when running the program without changing the root directory, it prints the files and directories in the system `/`.
We can notice that in the second output, number of files is larger as in the first case we created minimum files.
